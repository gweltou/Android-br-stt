## About

A proof of concept Android App to test a Breton language speech to text model build using Kaldi and [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/android). It is an offline STT system so the decoding is done on the device. No internet connection needed and no data is sent online.

Check the [releases](https://github.com/gweltou/Vosk-br-Android/releases) for pre-built binaries.

The process of building the STT model is described [here](https://github.com/gweltou/our-voices-model-competition/tree/main/submit/Open_Category/vosk-br). Helper scripts to build the model can be found there as well, or [here](https://github.com/gweltou/stt-tools)

A desktop command-line version is also available [here](https://github.com/gweltou/Vosk-bzg).
